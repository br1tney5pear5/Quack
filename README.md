# Quack
Quack is supposed to be a Twitter clone and was made it during the course of a week just to get handle on ASP.NET.
Turned out it felt a little bit empty so I decided to populate it with a few rather simple markov chain text generating bots.

Here are some previews of how it looks and feels:
